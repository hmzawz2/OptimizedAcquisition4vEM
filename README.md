**Data acquisition strategy of volume electron microscopy enables accurate image stack denoising using machine learning**

This repository provides the official implementation of our method for optimizing data acquisition in block-face volume electron microscopy (vEM). We demonstrate that deep learning-based denoisingâ€”under both supervised and self-supervised settings can accurately restore 3D structural details from noisy image stacks, allowing significantly higher imaging throughput without compromising downstream structural analysis.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

We recommend setting up a dedicated conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment_optimized_vem.yml
conda activate optimized_vem
```

## ðŸ§  Features

- Deep learning-based denoising framework for vEM
- Supports both supervised and self-supervised training
- Enables throughput-oriented acquisition strategies
- Generalizable to SBEM, FIB-SEM, and other block-face EM systems
- Includes scripts for training, inference, and evaluation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Place your own vEM `.tif` stack in `data/`.
2. Modify the configuration file in `configs/` to match your dataset and model.
3. Run supervised training:
   ```bash
   python train_supervised_denoise.py --config configs/supervised.yaml
   ```
4. Or run self-supervised training:
   ```bash
   python train_self_supervised_denoise.py --config configs/selfsup.yaml
   ```
5. Inference on a noisy stack:
   ```bash
   python volume_inference.py --input data/noisy_stack.tif --ckpt ckpt/best.pth
   ```
